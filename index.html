    <p>“Suddenly, Elaine heard that same sound. Strange, yet beautiful; calm, yet scary. She clung to her stone. It made her feel safe and secure, knowing it was for her own good. But then, her powers left her, and she crumbled under the thin rain...</p>
    
    <p>Weriden, located in the northernmost part of Solycto, was a small, sleepy town, where nothing really happened. Its beautiful woods and rustic landscape made it an ideal holiday destination. Its people were welcoming and quiet, though their calmness was sometimes annoying. Strangely, the only ones who dared to go there were brave hunters, or occasional summer camps. </p>
    
    <p>Elaine was one of those campers. She came there with some friends, hoping the mountain air would help her clear her mind from the busy city hustle. Optimist, adventurous, and sometimes silly, she was in many ways just the average teen. But she was special. The moment she entered the town, she knew something was amiss, and terrible things bound to happen.</p>
    
    <p>After unpacking her things, she left the camping site with her best friends, Aleyunn and Clueve. Elaine was set on finding out the weirdness of Weriden. They strolled through the woods, jumping over rotten tree trunks and piles of dead leaves. A few hours passed like mere minutes in that vast wilderness. The woods were filled with their chattering and laughter.</p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, Aleyunn said, , “Girls, shouldn’t we head back? After all, we are pretty far from the camping site, and I don’t really like the thought of us being here all alone, with dusk at our doorsteps.” Despite having six older brothers, she was the safe-girl of the three, and not scarce were the occasions when she had to pull them back from dangerous attempts of foolish bravery. Such was the case now.</p>
    
    <p>“Well, you have a point,” admitted Clueve, “but,” she continued, not very convinced, “we don’t have anything better to do back at the cabins. What do you say, Elaine?” Her words seemed to echo into the forest. “Elaine? Not again… Come out, wherever you are hiding!” Still no answer came. “Elaine, it’s not funny anymore!” Clueve exchanged worried looks with Aleyunn. They had no idea where she could be, not the slightest one…</p>
    
    <p>You might wonder, what happened with Elaine? Well, while her friends were admiring the woodland scenery, she deviated a bit from the trail, because, why not? She liked being by herself sometimes, so she wandered deeper into the forest. Soon, she came to a cave. The cave looked eerie enough, just the type she liked. But now that she thought of it, she dared not go through the entrance. It had something special and mysterious about it, but somewhat scary at the same time. Elaine turned back on the freshly-made trail, searching for her friends. </p>
    
    <p>Not long after, Elaine could hear Clueve and Aleyunn shouting her name, searching frantically. She wanted to surprise them a bit… So she jumped out of the bushes, right in front of them.</p>
    
    <p>“Hiya girls! Looking for something?” she asked, with a mischievous grin wide spread on her face. “I might help, if you want.”</p>
    
    <p>“Len, stop doing that! You’re gonna be my death cause!”</p>
    
    <p>“Oh, Aleyunn, you really need to chill. I was only further exploring the forest. And guess what found? A strange cave, waiting to have its mysteries unveiled!”</p>
    
    <p>Clueve squirmed uneasy. Her mistress wanted her not to get involved in any “strange” things; she once catched a famous burglar with her wit, and Miss Nalph took all the praise. She was then warned not to do “such a foolish thing” again. This left Clueve shaken, and very sad at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>But then, everything went black. The girls’ screams were the only sound to be heard. The curse of Weriden has finally gotten them. A black mist engulfed the forest. Elaine just knew it was coming from the cave; she did not know how, but now it didn’t matter. Her only thought was of escaping the terror that grasped her heart. </p>
    
    <p>Then, as if on command, the cries stopped. Everything seemed normal again. But it wasn’t. Elaine, Clueve and Aleyunn were the new prey of the Daymare, that terrifying hex from the little northern town. Nobody ever heard from them after…”</p>
    
    <p>With this, Madeline finished her story. She was known for her stories. They were known for their intricate design, unexpected twists, and unforgettable characters. What nobody knew was that they were all real. The creepy ones, the funny ones, the tragic ones, even the make-believe ones; every single one was filled with truth. Some predicted the future, some told the past. And Madeline took place in most of them. Under different names, but the same person. She was affected by all of them. But the future was about to change. She knew not about it. She dared not think about it. The future was a scary place, who almost never had happiness in store for her. Come to think about it, her stories predicted a happy haven, but her heart told her the exact opposite. Who would have guessed what could happen?</p>
    
    <p>"Madeline!"</p>
    
    <p>Madeline followed the voice. Ms. Bailey was calling her. Madeline was Ms. Bailey's servant.</p>
    
    <p>"Madeline, will you get me some tea?"</p>
    
    <p>Madeline got Ms. Bailey her tea, thinking the whole time about the story she was writing. So far, the situation worried her. It was unrealistic, but creepy nonetheless. This time, she had come up with a creature that sent chills down her spine. It seemed almost like a shadow. It was a deeper, darker black then anything she had ever seen, with piercing red eyes that seemed to stare into your soul. And its teeth were longer than Madeline's hand, and sharper than the knife Madeline was using to spread butter on Ms. Bailey's toast after Ms. Bailey asked her to. Ms. Bailey had a tendency to come up with chores for Madeline, then come up with even more with Madeline to do while she was already busy with the current chore.</p>
    
    <p>Madeline shivered, blinking away some sweat. <em>Sweat? </em>Her hand shook. Her stories always mirrored her soul, and Madeline loathed the pristine horror that she felt lurking just beneath her skin. Pleasurable, yet in an agonizing way. She couldn't be rid of the monster, because it was her monster, and it would stay with her forever. Unless. <em>Unless what, Madeline?</em> Unless there was another way.</p>
    <p>Madeline turned to the old, worn bookshelf on the other side of Ms. Bailey's living room and walked mechanically toward it. She fought the monster that tried to keep her back. She sank to her knees and found the Book she was looking for. <em>Dear God, can it be? What if these words are true?</em> She flipped through the worn pages, her forefinger caressing the small cross embedded in the cover. <em>What if?</em> </p>
    <p>She stopped at a page. The words were written clearly. Madeline's eyes were glued to the book. <em>What if!</em> Salvation hovered at her fingertips. All she had to do was accept. <em>Accept what?</em> Love. Sin. Salvation. And Him. She stared at the words. <em>"For whoever believes in Me shall have enternal life."</em></p>
    <p>She made her choice and set the book back on the shelf, feeling her monster gnash its teeth as it faded away. Her monster. And its name was --had been-- Madeline.</p>
